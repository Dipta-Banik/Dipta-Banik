# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Dipta Banik
### Data Science

As a computer science and engineering enthusiast, I'm particularly fascinated by the world of data science. I love working on real-life problems and are currently exploring programming and algorithms in my studies, with an eagerness to apply concepts such as statistics, machine learning, and data analysis to tackle such problems. With an interest in tinkering with datasets and taking on challenging projects, I'm honing skills while staying attuned to the latest trends in the field.

Skills:  C / PYTHON
